    <p>
        <b>ComMaid</b> is a communication aid for people who are unable or unwilling to speak. It is
        useful for both Deaf and non-Deaf people, such as people with situational mutism, or anyone who
        prefers typing over talking.

        You can use ComMaid offline without creating a room. If you create a room, you can share the
        link to allow others to see what you are typing in real time.
